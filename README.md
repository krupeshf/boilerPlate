### Purpose ###
I always wondered how to start a single page application project from ground up. <br />
One of the most difficult part to start a project is to get initial setup running.<br />
<br />
This is SPA project using<br />
* Durandal (Architecture)
* Knockout (Model-View-View-Modal)
* Require (Module loader)
* Bootstrap (CSS)
* Lodash (Utility library)
* TYPESCRIPT (Statically typed JavaScript)

### Install ###
Install all npm packages using `package.json`
```
npm install
```

### Usage ###
First compile all typescript files using the make file
```
make
```

Secondly start a small http-server so run the project
```
http-server -p <port_number>
```
