### Purpose ###
I always wondered how to start a single page application project from ground up.
One of the most difficult part to start a project is to get initial setup running.
This is SPA project using
1 - Durandal (Architecture)
2 - Knockout (Model-View-View-Modal)
3 - Require (Module loader)
4 - Bootstrap (CSS)
5 - Lodash (Utility library)
6 - TYPESCRIPT (Statically typed JavaScript)

### Install ###
```
npm install
```

### Usage ###
```
http-server -p <port_number>
```
